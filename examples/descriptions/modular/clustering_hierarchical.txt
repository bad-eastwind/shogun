In this example an agglomerative hierarchical single linkage clustering method
is used to cluster a given toy data set. Starting with each object being
assigned to its own cluster clusters are iteratively merged. Here the clusters
are merged that have the closest (minimum distance, here set via the Euclidean
distance object) two elements.
